**A**bstract **Se**nsor **I**nformation **A**rchitecture (ASEIA)
========================================================

Goal
----

This library provides the baseline facilities to extend any *Publish/Susbcribe* system to use Abstract Sensor Events as a machine readable interface between individually developed components.

Features
--------

**ASEIA** provides the following features on the *Abstract Sensor Events*:

* Statically typed Events to provide easy to use interfaces
* Dynamically typed Events to provide flexible computations
* Transformation Abstraction to provide often used computations in general waay
* KnowlegdeBase System to automatically search fitting TRansformations based on existing and requested EventTypes
* Virtual Arithmetics to provide an abstract computation framework to be used by the Transformations
